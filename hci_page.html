    <h2>HCI Main Project: CarlTune</h2>
    <h2>Teammates: Vanessa Heynes, Liam Keane, Kai Weiner</h2>

    <p>Our team chose to create a tool to address problems with the Carleton music scene: difficulties for students finding people to play music with, problems finding out about available on campus music performances to view, generally strengthening the music community at Carleton.</p>

    <h3>Final Figma Prototype:</h3>

    <p>My team received the following feedback from our final UX evaluation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users found it easy to navigate to some pages like settings (the gear icon was obvious)</li>
        <li>Users felt layout was intuitive</li>
        <li>Users wanted it to be more visually obvious what current tab they were on</li>
        <li>Users wanted a homepage</li>
        <li>Users wanted to be able to filter through type of musician</li>
        <li>Users wanted to toggle between condensed and spread out information</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I improved on the UX evaluation by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding a homepage users can navigate to by clicking the app logo</li>
        <li>Changing the color of the current tab to blue to display the user’s location in the app</li>
        <li>Added a type of musician filter on search page</li>
        <li>Added a visual settings option on settings for users to adjust size of posts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Figma Prototype 2:</h3>

    <p>1. Events board 
    Based on our transcriptions, it is clear that students find it difficult to find and keep track of events on campus. Both stakeholders mentioned that the main ways to find events is through word-of-mouth or campus posters. This makes it clear that students would benefit from being able to access a streamlined source of information to stay up to date on what opportunities are taking place and when. 
    </p>

    <p>2. Musicians board 
    Similar to the events board, there currently is not a reliable way to find other students to play music with. P1 indicates that finding other musicians is primarily done through pre-existing friendships, and P2 indicates that without musical friends, there is little to no opportunity for student musicians to play with others. There is also a wide variety of musical interests students may have that range on a spectrum of casual to serious, and creating a board of musicians’ profiles would allow students to express this nuanced information. 
    </p>

    <p>
    3. Privacy 
    Since we are designing a social media-esque platform, it is important to note that different users may have different levels of comfort with what information they share online. For this reason, we need to consider how to incorporate privacy in our design and allow users to show/hide as much or as little personal information they would like. This is not only important to users, but also events, as some events are open to the public while others are only open to those affiliated with Carleton.     
    </p>

    To address each requirement:

    <p>1. I tooled the main media page to specifically center around postings for on campus events and performances.</p>

    <p>2. I created a page for musicians to view the profiles of other people on campus (who chose to make their account public) as a tool for smoother online networking.</p>

    <img class="img-fluid w-100" src="img/people.png" alt="prototype 2 people page">

    <p>3. I created a settings page where users can manage who can see their posts, which posts they can see, and their profile visibility.</p>
